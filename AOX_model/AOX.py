# average transcription rate of 0.12 molecules/min. we take a higher number as AOX promoter should be highly induced under methanol condition. in the study peroxisomal gene CIT2 was transcribed at 1 molecule/min
# rna-seq data from phaffii reveals that it is highly transcribed; 85* higher number of reads (normalized) than average. we take 85 * 0.12 = 10.2 it seems too high. the highest observed in the pelechano study was 7.5, so 5 molecules/min might be good guess

# in the second paper, ribosomes per codon and protein synthesis rates are considered. it is quite clear that one can expect a ribosome every 10-100 codons. they state the AA/s rate as ranging from 1-20, so we will keep 7.5 and simulate with 5 ribosomes per transcript as a conservative guess and within their average rates.
